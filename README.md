# Financial Stock Market Analysis

This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing financial stock market data using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The analysis was performed on a dataset spanning five years (2016-2021) and covering 30 different stocks.

## Experiments

1. **Descriptive, Prescriptive, and Predictive Statistics**: Analyzed the dataset to understand its characteristics and make predictions about future stock prices.
2. **Linear Regression**: Applied linear regression to model the relationship between independent variables and stock prices.
3. **Logistic Regression**: Used logistic regression to perform classification tasks on the stock market dataset.
4. **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations to explore patterns and trends in the stock market data.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Calculated the correlation matrix and plotted correlation plots to understand relationships among different variables in the dataset.
6. **Matrix Decomposition**: Performed Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or other matrix decomposition techniques to analyze the structure of the dataset.
7. **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducted hypothesis testing to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data.
8. **ANOVA Testing**: Applied analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing to compare means across multiple groups in the dataset.
9. **Classification**: Installed relevant packages for classification and evaluated the performance of classifiers using techniques like Particle Swarm Optimization for Support Vector Machine.
10. **Optimization Algorithm Research**: Prepared a research paper discussing the application of optimization algorithms to stock market analysis.
